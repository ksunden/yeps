# Abstract

This YEP describes the configuration file format for yaq daemons.
This is a TOML file with some reserved and required keys.

# Motivation

A standard for configuration makes it easy to know how one configures their daemon.
TOML is a well defined, human readable configuration file format.
This provides a flexible configuration format, including the ability to share settings across multiple daemons.

# Specification

The configuration file is a [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file.

## File Location

The default configuration file location SHALL be:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/yaqd/<kind>/config.toml`
- XDG Spec (e.g. Linux): `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/yaqd/<kind>/config.toml`
- Windows: `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\yaq\yaqd\<kind>\config.toml`

Where `<kind>` is a lowercase name for the daemon with words separated by hyphens.

## Enable

An optional top level key for `enable` is a boolean value.
If `false`, the daemon MUST exit immediately without opening TCP ports.
If not given, `true` is assumed.

## Shared Settings

An optional top level table, which if present, provides defaults that apply to all other tables.
These defaults are higher priority than implementation defined defaults, but lower than configuration for individual daemon ports.

## Individual Daemon Configuration

Every other top-level key MUST be a table, for which the name indicates the name of the daemon which MUST be exposed on the given port. These names MUST be unique at the level of `<kind>`.

Each table MUST include a key `port` which provides the globally-unique (among all daemons) TCP port.
Additional fields MAY be added, as needed for configuring the daemon.
Specific implementations MAY have additional required configuration parameters.

ALL tables other than those that are disabled, and `shared-settings` MUST be started when invoking a daemon entry point with the config file.
They MAY (and in many cases must for technical reasons) start several daemons listening in the same process.

The configuration file MUST NOT be written by the daemon.
Any runtime dynamic fields SHOULD be written in the [state file](https://yeps.yaq.fyi/yep-103) and have ways of detecting and/or expose setting over the TCP communication protocol described above.

Additional identifying information SHOULD be included, as applicable.
Common identifying information include: `make` (manufacturer), `model` (identifies the kind as described by the manufacturer), `serial` (individual serial number of the device represented).
This limited subset (along with the `<name>` as defined by the table name and the `<kind>` as defined by the implementation) are returned by the `id` method.

The configuration file MUST be read from the file at daemon startup ONLY (restarting is considered "startup", and MUST re-read the configuration file in case changes were made).
