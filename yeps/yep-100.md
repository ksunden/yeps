# Abstract

This YEP describes an updated [remote procedure call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) format.
In brief, the format is largely based on [JSON-RPC v2](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification), however using [msgpack](https://msgpack.org) for data serialization instead of JSON.
As such, all valid msgpack data types are available to use.
This is strictly a superset of what is allowed with JSON alone.

# Motivation

When the project started, we decided that a daemon architecture built on top of an RPC was greatly beneficial.
At the time, we chose JSON as the serialization because of its ubiquity and human readability.
The first implementation was an RPC interface of our own design.
We then found JSON-RPC, which was largely very similar to what we had come up with, but importantly had a standard written and a community of people using it already.

As time progressed, we found the JSON to be prohibitively verbose for sending large numeric arrays, and thus looked to msgpack as an alternative that is more compact and can handle binary data.
This format is less human readable, but is more easily machine readable, and easily converted into human readable format.

This YEP addresses the standardization of this format.

# Specification

## Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

All member names exchanged between the Client and the Server that are considered for matching of any kind should be considered to be case-sensitive. The terms function, method, and procedure can be assumed to be interchangeable.

The Client is defined as the origin of Request objects and the handler of Response objects.
The Server is defined as the origin of Response objects and the handler of Request objects.

## Type System

Any valid [msgpack type](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md) MAY be used.
For maximum compatibility with other serializers (e.g. TOML used for other parts of the yaq ecosystem), Map keys MUST be String types.

In addition to the standard types, the Timestamp extension is explicitly required by yaq-RPC.
Any extension types specified will be separate YEPs.

Valid types include (with various sizes/binary encodings):
- Integer
- Nil
- Boolean
- Float
- Raw UTF-8 String
- Raw Binary Data
- Array of valid type obects (heterogeneous)
- Map of key-value pairs (keys are UTF-8 Strings)
- [Timestamp](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md#timestamp-extension-type)
- [YEP-110](https:/yeps.yaq.fyi/110) defined N-Dimensional array

## Request Message

A rpc call is represented by sending a Request message to a Server. The Request message has the following members:

- **ver**:  A String specifying the version of the yaq-RPC protocol. MUST be exactly "1.0". Note that this name differs from the name in JSON-RPC.
- **method**: A String containing the name of the method to be invoked. Method names that begin with the word rpc followed by a period character (U+002E or ASCII 46) are reserved for rpc-internal methods and extensions and MUST NOT be used for anything else.
- **params**: A Structured value that holds the parameter values to be used during the invocation of the method. This member MAY be omitted.
- **id**: An identifier established by the Client that MUST contain a String or Integer value if included. If it is not included it is assumed to be a notification. The Server MUST reply with the same value in the Response message if included. This member is used to correlate the context between the two messages.

### Notification

A Notification is a Request message without an "id" member. A Request message that is a Notification signifies the Client's lack of interest in the corresponding Response message, and as such no Response message needs to be returned to the client. The Server MUST NOT reply to a Notification.

Notifications are not confirmable by definition, since they do not have a Response message to be returned. As such, the Client would not be aware of any errors (like e.g. "Invalid params","Internal error").

### Parameter Structures

If present, parameters for the rpc call MUST be provided as a Structured value. Either by-position through an Array or by-name through a Map.

- by-position: params MUST be an Array, containing the values in the Server expected order. Defaults apply to trailing params which are omitted (and MUST have default values to be omitted).
- by-name: params MUST be a Map, with String keys representing names that match the Server expected parameter names. The absence of expected names MAY result in an error being generated. The names MUST match exactly, including case, to method's expected parameters. Order does not matter, and there MAY be default values for omitted parameters.

## Response Message

When a rpc call is made, the Server MUST reply with a Response, except for in the case of Notifications. The Response is expressed as a single msgpack Map, with the following members:

- **ver**: A String specifying the version of the yaq-RPC protocol. MUST be exactly "1.0". Note that this name differs from the name in JSON-RPC.
- **result**: This member is REQUIRED on success. This member MUST NOT exist if there was an error invoking the method. The value of this member is determined by the method invoked on the Server.
- **error**:  This member is REQUIRED on error. This member MUST NOT exist if there was no error triggered during invocation. The value for this member MUST be an Map as defined below.
- **id**: This member is REQUIRED. It MUST be the same as the value of the id member in the Request Message. If there was an error in detecting the id in the Request object (e.g. Parse error/Invalid Request), it MUST be Nil.

Either the result member or error member MUST be included, but both members MUST NOT be included.

### Error object
When a rpc call encounters an error, the Response Message MUST contain the error member with a value that is a Map with the following members:

- **code**: A Number that indicates the error type that occurred. This MUST be an integer.
- **message**: A String providing a short description of the error. The message SHOULD be limited to a concise single sentence.
- **data**:  A Primitive or Structured value that contains additional information about the error. This may be omitted. The value of this member is defined by the Server (e.g. detailed error information, nested errors etc.).

The error codes from and including -32768 to -32000 are reserved for pre-defined errors. Any code within this range, but not defined explicitly below is reserved for future use. The error codes are nearly the same as those suggested for XML-RPC at the following url (and exactly those defined by JSON-RPC): http://xmlrpc-epi.sourceforge.net/specs/rfc.fault_codes.php


| code | message | meaning |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|-32700| 	Parse error	| Invalid Message was received by the server. An error occurred on the server while parsing the Message.|
|-32600| 	Invalid Request| 	The Message sent is not a valid Request message.|
|-32601| 	Method not found	| The method does not exist / is not available.|
|-32602| 	Invalid params| 	Invalid method parameter(s).|
|-32603| 	Internal error| 	Internal yaq-RPC error.|
|-32000 to -32099| 	Server error| 	Reserved for implementation-defined server-errors.|

The remainder of the space is available for application defined errors.


# Reference Implementation

Implementations in python for the [daemon](https://gitlab.com/yaq/yaqd-core-python/-/merge_requests/58) and [client](https://gitlab.com/yaq/yaqc-python/-/merge_requests/7) portions are provided.

# Rejected Ideas

## JSON-RPC v2

See [JSON-RPC v2](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).
This was the existing implementation.

JSON-RPC is nicely quite simple. It is also relatively ubiquitous, and based on an even more ubiquitous serialization format.
msgpack was preferred for its berevity and increased type availability.
While not as ubiquitous, implementations exist for all of the most popular lanuages.

While the structure of the requests and responses was quite nice, JSON as a serialization language is relatively limited and much more verbose compared to msgpack.
The lack of binary data types in particular leads to explosion of extra communication bandwith needed, without actually transmitting additional information.
This becomes especially relevant as we look to support daemons sending large arrays of (usually floating point) numbers, where JSON requires sometimes as much as 2.5 times the number of bytes required.
Attempts to shoehorn in binary data are not satisfactory solutions, as they either end up using many escape sequences.

## msgpack-rpc

[msgpack-rpc](https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc/blob/master/spec.md) is an existing standard for doing RPC using msgpack.

In many respects, it is a very good specification.
Where it falls short for our use case is that we have come to rely on the ability to use keyword based arguments for the RPC. This is not supported by msgpack-rpc.

As such, strict compliance to the standard does not suit our usage.

Additionally there is not a particularly large (or at least vocal) community using the standard.

## zerorpc

[zerorpc](https://zerorpc.io) similarly does not provide for keyword arguments (though with a note for a suggested workaround).
The [zerorpc specification](https://github.com/0rpc/zerorpc-python/blob/master/doc/protocol.md) is listed as "incomplete", and has not seen updates in 5 years.

zerorpc is also rejected because it specifies more that we wish to specify here:
- zerorpc _must_ use ZeroMQ sockets
- zerorpc implements heartbeat, streaming, and other more complicated communication modes

## Opening an additional port for raw binary data

This was deemed a configurational and practical nightmare to organize and assure data integrity.

## Using base64 encoded binary data

See [a rejected implementation](https://gitlab.com/yaq/yaqd-core-python/-/merge_requests/31).

This was an idea for reducing _some_ of the size burden incumbent on JSON for transmitting large arrays.

Using base64 introduces additional complexity, and requires copying data into new memory locations, something that at least in theory can be avoided with msgpack in many cases.
