# Abstract

This YEP defines the standard for entry points for yaq daemons.
The entry point executable name is defined as `yaqd-<kind>` where `<kind>` is a lower case name for the daemon with words separated by hyphens.
Additionally, this defines flags required on the entry points

# Motivation

A standard for names and options available makes for a consistent, easy to swap out way of initiating daemons.

# Specification

The standard entry point to initiate a daemon SHALL be yaqd- <kind> where <kind> is a lowercase name for the daemon with words separated by hyphens.

Examples of valid entry points include `yaqd-base`, `yaqd-micro-hr` , and `yaqd-zaber-binary`.

The entry point SHALL accept the option `--help` and the short form `-h` of this option, which prints usage information and exts without starting daemons.

The entry point SHALL accept the option `--config <filepath>` and the short form `-c` of this option.

The entry point SHALL accept the option `--version <filepath>` which prints version information and exits without starting daemons. 
Version information MUST include the version of the yaq specification.
