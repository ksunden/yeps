# Abstract

This YEP defines the standard for entry points for yaq daemons.
The entry point executable name is defined as `yaqd-<kind>` where `<kind>` is a lower case name for the daemon with words separated by hyphens.
Additionally, this defines flags required on the entry points.
There is a 1-to-1 correspondance between entry point invocations and [YEP-102](https://yeps.yaq.fyi/102) confguration files.
As such, multiple daemons MAY be started in a single entry point.

# Motivation

A standard for names and options available makes for a consistent, easy to swap out way of initiating daemons.

# Specification

The standard entry point to initiate a daemon SHALL be `yaqd-<kind>` where `<kind>` is a lowercase name for the daemon with words separated by hyphens, as returned by the `id` method of the daemon.

Examples of valid entry points include `yaqd-hardware`, `yaqd-micro-hr` , and `yaqd-zaber-binary`.

The entry point SHALL accept the option `--help` and the short form `-h` of this option, which prints usage information and exts without starting daemons.

The entry point SHALL accept the option `--config <filepath>` and the short form `-c` of this option.
Each daemon specified by the config file SHALL be started.
They MAY (and for technical reasons must in some cases) be served from the same process.

The entry point SHALL accept the option `--version <filepath>` which prints version information and exits without starting daemons.
Version information MUST include the version of the yaq specification.
