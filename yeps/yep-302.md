# Abstract

This YEP defines the is-sensor trait.
Daemons implementing this trait make measurements.

# Table of Contents

[TOC]

# Motivation

Sensors are a core component of the instrumentation ecosystem.
The is-sensor trait enforces a consistent interface across all measurement devices.

# Proposal

Because this trait has no setters, daemons implementing only this trait should always be busy.
Daemons that also implement other traits, e.g. has-measure-trigger, do implement setters and therefore may release busy.

## message: get_measured

response: {type: map, values: [float, ndarray]}

Get most recent measured value.

## message: get_channel_names

response: {'type': 'array', 'items': 'string'}

Get map of channel names.

## message: get_channel_shapes

response: {'type': 'map', 'values': {'type': 'array', 'items': 'int'}}

Get map of current channel shapes. Scalar represented by empty list.

## message: get_channel_units

response: {'type': 'map', 'values': ['null', 'string']}

Get current channel units.
