# Abstract

This yep is currently a stub which will be filled out with more explicit reasoning.
The short version is that yaq uses [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org) to communicate schema information and serialize RPC calls/responses.
Using explicit schemas communicated during the handshake makes type information very concrete and well determined, which we hope will make implementations outside of Python easier.

# Motivation

# Specification

As we are using an outside specification, we will not copy the full specification here.
The full specification can be found at [Avro's Website](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html)

yaq uses Avro as an RPC over TCP sockets (without http headers) with stateful handshaking supported.

# Rejected Ideas

- [YEP-100](../100) - No schemas, wish to use an existing standard

# Discussion

Discussion can be found on the [gitlab issue](https://gitlab.com/yaq/yeps/-/issues/11) for this YEP.
