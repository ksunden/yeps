# Motivation

Certain positional hardware can be homed.
This trait enforces consistency across the yaq ecosystem for such hardware.

# Proposal

This trait requires has-position: see [YEP-301](https://yeps.yaq.fyi/301/).
Daemons with this trait need only implement one message.

## message: home

Initiates the homing procedure. The daemon will report as busy during the homing procedure. After the homing procedure is complete, the daemon will return to the current destination.
