# Motivation

Certain positional hardware has an additional turret.
This trait ensures consistant interfaces for such hardware across the yaq ecosystem.

# Proposal

Turret position is represented using a string identifier.
Daemons should return busy while turret position is changing.

type: string or null

## message: get_turret

response: string or null

Get current turret identifier.

## message: get_turret_options

response: list of string

Get current turret identifier options.

## message: set_turret
